Contributor Assignment Agreement (CLA)
=====================================

This agreement governs rights in any contribution (code, docs, tests, assets,
etc.) you submit to this repository.

Parties
-------
- Project Owner/Maintainer: Jan Paulzen (VoltKraft) — “Project Owner”
- Contributor: the person submitting a contribution — “Contributor”

Scope
-----
This CLA applies to all “Contributions” you submit to this repository (pull
requests, patches, snippets, files, or code posted in issues/discussions).

Copyright Assignment
--------------------
1. Assignment. The Contributor hereby assigns to the Project Owner all right,
   title, and interest worldwide in and to the Contributions, including all
   copyrights and exclusive rights of exploitation in any form and media (now
   known or later developed).
2. Rights Granted. Without limitation, the assignment includes the rights to
   reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, display, make available, create
   derivative works, modify, combine with other works, sublicense, relicense,
   and relicense under open‑source or proprietary terms (including dual
   licensing and future relicensing of the project).
3. Nature of Assignment. The assignment is irrevocable, royalty‑free,
   transferable, and sublicensable. Previously released project versions remain
   under the license(s) stated at the time of their release.

Moral Rights and Attribution
----------------------------
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Contributor waives and/or agrees
not to assert moral rights in the Contributions against the Project Owner and
its licensees. The Project Owner may credit Contributors at its discretion but
is not obligated to do so.

Contributor Representations
---------------------------
The Contributor represents and warrants that:
- they have the necessary rights to make the Contributions and to assign them
  as set out above (including, if applicable, employer consent);
- the Contributions do not knowingly infringe third‑party rights;
- any third‑party material included is appropriately licensed and identified;
- no confidential or proprietary information of others is disclosed.

Project License and Future Relicensing
--------------------------------------
The project is currently licensed under AGPL‑3.0‑only (see `LICENSE`). The
Project Owner may release future versions of the project under different
licenses. This CLA enables such relicensing while preserving the licensing of
already‑released versions.

Acceptance
----------
By submitting a Contribution (including opening a pull request), you confirm
that you have read and agree to this CLA. If you cannot agree, please do not
submit Contributions.
