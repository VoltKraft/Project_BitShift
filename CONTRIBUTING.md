# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Bug fixes, docs improvements, and small features are all welcome.

Note on project nature: this is a single‑maintainer hobby project. There is no SLA, no commercial support, and reviews happen on a best‑effort basis.

## Code of Conduct

Please follow the guidelines in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Be respectful and constructive.

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs: open an issue with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment, and sample output if possible.
- Suggest features: open an issue first to discuss scope and fit. Small, incremental improvements are preferred over large refactors.
- Improve docs: PRs that clarify the README, examples, or error messages are highly appreciated.
- Security: do not post vulnerabilities publicly. See `SECURITY.md` for private reporting.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused; one change per PR when possible.
- Discuss major changes in an issue before implementation.


## Style and Quality

- Follow PEP 8 in spirit; prefer readable, simple code over cleverness.
- Use type hints where practical; keep functions small and focused.
- Keep output user‑friendly and consistent with existing messages.
- Add comments or docstrings only where they clarify intent (no boilerplate).

## Commit Messages

- Keep them concise and informative. Prefixes like `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `refactor:` are welcome but not required.
- Reference related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## License and Contribution Terms

Before we can merge your contribution, you must agree to the project’s
Contributor Assignment Agreement (CLA). This assigns copyright in your
contributions to the Project Owner so the project can be relicensed in the
future if needed.

- Agreement: please read `CLA.md` and confirm your consent in the PR (see
  template).
- Project license: the repository is currently released under AGPL‑3.0‑only.
  See `LICENSE`.
- Rights: you represent that you have the necessary rights to contribute and
  that your contribution does not infringe third‑party rights.

If you cannot agree to the CLA, please do not submit contributions.

## Maintainer Availability

Reviews and releases are best‑effort and may take time. Thank you for your patience and for helping improve Project_BitShift!
