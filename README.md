## 🧭 Overview

**Chronos** (Project_BitShift) is a modern, web-based planning and scheduling  
system designed as a replacement for:

- manual Excel-based duty planning  
- paper-based vacation & approval processes  
- non-transparent scheduling procedures  

Chronos provides:

- ✔ Digital approval workflows  
- ✔ Transparent, auditable planning  
- ✔ Fair, constraint-aware scheduling  
- ✔ A Linux-first, open source-friendly architecture  
- ✔ Modular frontend & backend components  
- ✔ A foundation for future automation and optimization

Project documentation is kept in the `docs/` directory:

- **Customer Requirements Specification**  
  `docs/customer-requirements-specification.md`

- **Functional Specification**  
  `docs/functional-specification.md`  
  Key sections: [Interfaces & OpenAPI](docs/functional-specification.md#6-interfaces) · [Deployment & 12-Factor](docs/functional-specification.md#8-deployment--operations)

## 🏗 Architecture Overview (Phase 1)

Phase 1 runs as a small set of containers: reverse-proxy, frontend, middleware/api, scheduler/worker, and Postgres. The API is OpenAPI-first and authentication uses session cookies (internal users only).

```mermaid

  Client -->|HTTPS /api/*| RP
  RP -->|HTTP| FE -->|HTTP /api/*| API
  RP -->|HTTP /api/*| API -->|SQL| DB
  API -.->|job trigger| Worker -->|SQL| DB
```

See `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/authentication.md` for details.

---

## 🔧 Development Setup

Phase 1 runs as a single `docker compose` stack. Dev defaults are committed in `infrastructure/docker/.env.dev`; production secrets live in `infrastructure/docker/.env.prod` which is **gitignored**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VoltKraft/Project_BitShift.git
cd Project_BitShift/infrastructure/docker

# Build + start all five services (Traefik, frontend, api, worker, db)
./up.sh up --build

# Create the first admin (prompted for password)
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml --env-file .env.dev exec api \
  python -m app.cli create-admin --email admin@chronos.local

# Verify
curl -i http://localhost/healthz
```

Once the stack is up, the SPA is at <http://localhost/>. Traefik routes `/api/*`, `/auth/*`, `/healthz`, `/readyz` to the API; everything else goes to the frontend.

For the full inventory of containers, images, and endpoints see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md#implementation-status-phase-1).
